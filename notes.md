#Serenity Project Serenity BDD is an open source library that aims to make the idea of living documentation a reality.

Here is the link for simple documentation.

###Steps to Create Project 1.Create a maven project called SerenityProject

2.under pom.xml 1.add below property section

<properties>
<maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
<maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>
3.Add dependencies

        <!-- This is for base support for anything we do with serenity-->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-core</artifactId>
                <version>2.4.4</version>
            </dependency>
        <!-- This is the dependency that wrap up rest assured with additional serenity support-->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-rest-assured</artifactId>
                <version>2.4.4</version>
            </dependency>

            
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
                <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
                <version>5.8.2</version>
            </dependency>
                    <!--Junit 5 support for serenity -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>io.github.fabianlinz</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-junit5</artifactId>
                <version>1.6.0</version>
            </dependency>
4.Add Build plugins

  <build>
        <plugins>

            <!--            This is where the report is being generated after the test run -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.4.4</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>serenity-reports</id>
                        <phase>post-integration-test</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>aggregate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
            <!--         We want to run all the tests then generate one report -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
                <configuration>
                    <testFailureIgnore>true</testFailureIgnore>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
5.Create a package called com/cydeo under src/test/java

under cydeo create spartan and under spartan create admin packages

create a class called SpartanAdminGetTest

6.Create regular @Test rest api class getAllSpartan and send a request.

7.This is just regular test, in order to make it recognized by serenity reports

add annotation class level : @SerenityTest
it is coming from import net.serenitybdd.junit5.SerenityTest;
Add a properties file with exact name serenity.properties right under project level
add following lines to properties file
serenity.project.name=API Report
serenity.test.root=cydeo
9.In order to generate serenity report, we need to use maven goal

if you are using command line: mvn clean verify cmd+enter or ctrl+enter if you dont have maven installed locally
if you are using IntelliJ buttons;
first click on clean then click on verify
your report will be generated under target as HTML Report
10.This is for serenity to pick up log and eliminate the warning

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>
We were able to generate test report, however there are no details about the request and response. In order to see the details then we need to use the given() when() then() methods coming from Serenity.

Instead of importing rest assured given import,use below
import static net.serenitybdd.rest.SerenityRest.given;
From this point on, all details will be picked up by Serenity report, you will see Rest Query button on the individual tests
The way that assert the response and show it as a steps in Serenity report is using Ensure class (from import net.serenitybdd.rest.Ensure;)

        Ensure.that("Status code is 200",validatableResponse -> validatableResponse.statusCode(201) );

        Ensure.that("Content-type is JSON",vRes -> vRes.contentType(ContentType.JSON));

        Ensure.that("Id is 15", vRes -> vRes.body("id",is(15)));
Serenity Day 2
We did Parameterized Test using Junit 5 @ParameterizedTest using Value Source and CSVSource.

Here is the full example

Serenity Properties
There are two special file that used by serenity for properties.

Both of them can be accessible using the ConfigReader Class by providing property name.

serenity.properties
This file can either be under

root directory
src/test/resources
It's a key-value pair like regular properties file only difference is , all key value pairs will be added as system env variable at run time

serenity.conf
The structure looks as below , we can store environment specific data and run the project against different environment by selecting environment in maven command

environments {
default {
base.url = "http://library1.cydeo.com"
librarian.username = "librarian60@library"
librarian.password = "NyLIiSAm"
}
library1 {
base.url = "http://library1.cydeo.com"
librarian.username = "librarian60@library"
librarian.password = "NyLIiSAm"
}
library2 {
base.url = "http://library2.cydeo.com"
librarian.username = "librarian60@library"
librarian.password = "Lj5VU4Tq"
}
library3 {
base.url = "http://library3.cydeo.com"
librarian.username = "librarian60@library"
librarian.password = "yNFS9ghh"
}
all{
base.path = "/rest/v1"
}
}
It starts with environments :

default : for default values if no envronment specified
custom environment name like library1 library2
key value pair under that environment
common value for all environment goes to all section
Selecting Environment can be achieved as below using maven command

mvn clean verify -Denvironment=YourEnvironmentNameGoesHere
Actual code we wrote to access these key value pair is using getProperty method of ConfigReader class

        System.out.println( ConfigReader.getProperty("base.url")  );
        System.out.println( ConfigReader.getProperty("librarian.username")  );
Above code will generate different result according to the environment you selected.

This will enable running same set of tests against different environment.

How to run specific class with maven

mvn clean verify -Denvironment=YourEnvironmentNameGoesHere -Dtest=ClassName
